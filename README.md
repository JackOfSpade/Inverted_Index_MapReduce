Why is this important?
This allows us to easily find, for example, all 

Your task is to design and implement MapReduce algorithms that given a collection of Yelp businesses:
â€¢ compute the inverted index of the categories to businesses (iimaper.py, iireducer.py)
and output the results in a file called inverted-index.txt
The collection of businesses is provided in a file yelp_business.csv that follows the same format
as the original data set provided by Kaggle. The contents of the file might vary when testing your code.
